# <Homework 01>
## Description

For homework01, we were tasked to refactor existing code to make it more symantic and accessible. I first added alt tages to all the images and i then removed some of the div tags and replaced them with tags like section, aside, article, and nav. BVy removing the div tags it makes the html file more accessible and symantic. 

This homeworks really through me off and i felt like i was over thinking alot of the tags. I had to use google and watch tutorials to figure out exactly what the homeworks was asking. I am still not sure if it is correct but i am going to continue to work on symantic html and what tags make a website for accessible.
